### Hey Friends! ðŸ‘‹

Hi. Iâ€™m Keeley. I'm currently coding cool stuff and occassional garbage in Node, React and C++. I love horror movies, running long distances, [mountains and hiking](https://portlandartmuseum.org/exhibitions/volcano/), and big dogs.

I work at Slack as a Senior Software Engineer, and I'm a member of Electron's governance team. If you want to chat, you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/keeleyhammond) or email me at [vertedinde@electronjs.org](mailto:vertedinde@electronjs.org).
